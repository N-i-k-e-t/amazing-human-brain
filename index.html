            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The human brain is the most complex command center in the known universe. Weighing only about 3 pounds, it controls everything you think, feel, and do. It contains a staggering 86 billion neurons – tiny cells that form an unimaginably intricate network of connections!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cool Fact #1:</strong>  The brain can generate about 20 watts of power – enough to light a dim bulb.</li> 
                <li><strong>Cool Fact #2:</strong> Your brain keeps developing connections well into your 20s.</li> 
            </ul>

    <h2>How We Learn</h2>
    <p>Think of your brain like a vast forest filled with tiny messengers called <strong>neurons</strong>. When you learn something, they send signals to each other, creating pathways. The more you use the pathway (by practicing or recalling information), the stronger it gets!</p>
    
    <h3>Neuroplasticity: Your Brain the Transformer</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity means your brain is moldable! Throughout your life, it can change in amazing ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forging New Paths:</strong> Learning creates new connections between neurons.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthening Connections:</strong> The more you use them, the faster and easier signals travel along pathways. </li>
        <li><strong>Branching Out:</strong>  Sometimes, your brain can even sprout entirely new neurons!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Memory</h3>
    <p> Not all memories are created equal. Here's a quick breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> Brief echoes of your senses, like a fading smell.</li>
        <li><strong>Short-term Memory:</strong>  Your brain's scratchpad, holding a few things briefly (like a phone number).</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term Memory:</strong>  The massive storehouse of your knowledge and experiences. Includes both facts (historical dates) and skills (riding a bike).</li> 
    </ul>
    <p><em>* A simple infographic of these memory types would look awesome here*</em></p>

<section id="ai-comparison">
    <h2>AI vs. The Brain</h2>
    <h3>Similarities</h3>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), especially the field called machine learning, actually takes inspiration from how our brains work.  Both brains and AI systems can "learn" by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding patterns in huge amounts of data.</li>
        <li>Adjusting and improving their performance based on those patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where the Brain Still Reigns</h3>
    <p>Despite AI's incredible advances, our brains still have some major advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>  Our brains use amazingly little energy compared to even the best AI computers.  </li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> We can learn new skills unrelated to old ones - AI often struggles with this transfer of knowledge.</li> 
        <li><strong>The Mysteries:</strong>  Things like consciousness, creativity, and common sense remain deeply complex  - scientists and AI researchers are still figuring this out!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Ethical Questions</h3>
    <p>As AI gets smarter, it raises big questions. Should these systems have certain rights?  Who's responsible if they make harmful decisions? It's important to think about these things alongside the amazing progress we're making in AI.</p>
